    <h2>Project 1 <em> Fire evacuation game </h2>
        <p>Wildfires have become a chronic catastrophe in California with a rapidly changing risk landscape. 
            We cannot rely solely on historical data and empirical solutions to form evacuation strategies; 
            it must be admitted that changes in fire propagation patterns and different human 
            behavior patterns depend on various variables (e.g., cellular network status,  road conditions, 
            communication method).

             Our research group has been investigating the socio-technological challenges faced by communities 
             at the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). And this game is to create a cost-effective method for 
             stakeholders to participate in realistic evacuation drills,
              an efficient data collection framework for gaining insight into behavioral and physical uncertainties, 
              and a robust human-computer interaction platform for visualizing effective evacuation strategies.

            We provided two versions of game(Windows and Mac), you can download from this 
            <a href="https://github.com/bolinas-game/spatial_queue/releases/tag/game_20220815">link</a> and try it. For more information about background algorithm,
