	<h1>About me</h1>
	<!-- <p>Hope I can share some useful information! <em> fslj<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p> -->
	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Kenichi Soga.
		 Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor degree from North China Electric Power University (Beijing)
		 and master degree from Tsinghua University.

		My research direction lies in traffic control, optimization and simulation. I did project on vehicle 
		ridesharing algorithm, fire evacuation algorithm and micro traffic simulation previously. I explore how
		to use reinforcement learning to optimize the vehicle' s movement recently.
		
		I am also interested in visualization methods and game design.
