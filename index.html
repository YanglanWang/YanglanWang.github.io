		 Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor degree from North China Electric Power University (Beijing)
		 and master degree from Tsinghua University.

		My research direction lies in traffic control, optimization and simulation. I did project on vehicle 
		ridesharing algorithm, fire evacuation algorithm and micro traffic simulation previously. I explore how
		to use reinforcement learning to optimize the vehicle' s movement recently.

		I am also interested in visualization methods and game design.
